/**
 * The channel lane: 扫码登录 vendors served through the host's own LLM seam.
 *
 * ## Why this is a separate lane
 *
 * Every other lane reaches its upstream over HTTP this plugin owns: the pool
 * posts to WorkBuddy, the aggregate lane posts to a provider the user keyed, the
 * free lane posts to a pooled gateway. The login channels do not work that way.
 * `vendor/channel-pack` registers each one as a HOST adapter
 * (`llm.registerAdapter([product.id], adapter)`) — the credential, the wire
 * dialect and the endpoint all belong to the pack, and there is no
 * OpenAI-compatible port for a client to point at.
 *
 * So this lane opens no socket. It calls `ctx.llm`, which already knows how to
 * reach every registered provider, and translates between the two vocabularies.
 * The listing is built the same way, from `llm.listModels`, which is what the
 * card's own model list already calls: a channel that is not signed in throws,
 * the throw becomes "contributes nothing", and the gateway therefore cannot
 * advertise a channel the card would not show.
 *
 * ## What is translated
 *
 * The host stream vocabulary is `block-start | text-delta | reasoning-delta |
 * tool-call-delta | block-end | usage | finish` (dsh-llm `types.d.ts`), and each
 * of the four that carry content has an OpenAI spelling, so nothing is dropped on
 * the way out — including tool calls, which a gateway that silently swallowed
 * them would make look like a model that refuses to use tools.
 *
 * On the way in, every message becomes the host's `content: ContentBlock[]`;
 * a bare string is rejected by the host's own validation, which is the exact bug
 * fixed in `model-probe.ts`, so this lane does not repeat it.
 *
 * Images must go through the host's durable attachment store, for the same
 * reason: the typed `ImageBlock` (dsh-llm `types.d.ts`) has no `url` field at
 * all — only `attachment: ImageAttachmentRef`. A base64 `image_url` part is
 * therefore decoded and handed to `attachments.saveImage`, and the reference that
 * comes back is what goes into the block. Emitting `{ type: 'image', url }` is
 * the failure mode this note exists for: the host does not reject it, it simply
 * is not an image as far as the host is concerned, so the picture is dropped and
 * the model narrates the text alone — a solid red square came back described as
 * white, with a token count that proved nothing had arrived. A remote `http(s)`
 * URL is refused rather than fetched, matching the pack's own bridge, so the
 * gateway never becomes a fetch primitive on someone else's behalf.
 *
 * ## One deliberate difference from the pool lane
 *
 * The pool forces `stream: true` (`prepareChatBody`), so a client asking for a
 * non-streaming completion still receives SSE from it. This lane honours
 * `stream: false`. Copying the deviation would make the gateway's behaviour
 * depend on which lane a model happens to sit in — the kind of difference a
 * client cannot see coming and discovers as a parse error.
